  	<h1 class="title">Rowing,<em>"a sport which involves propelling a boat on water using oars"</em> </h1>
        
        <p>Rowing is the act of propelling a boat through the water with the use of oars. In a rowing shell, the rower sits on a seat that moves both forward and backward. This enables the rower to bend and straighten his or her legs increasing the length of each stroke.</p>
       
        <h2>Types of rowing</h2>
        
        <p>The sport has two basic types of rowing: sweep rowing and sculling. In sweep rowing, athletes hold one oar with both hands while in sculling, the athletes have two oars, one in each hand.</p>

        <h2>Reaons to row</h2> 
        <p>People sometimes wonder why they would choose rowing as a sport they would want to pursue so below are some reasons why it should be chosen
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rowing Is a full body workout and a recreational activity which offers a complete physical and mental workout</li>
  <li>Rowing puts you in a refreshing and beautiful environment while you are on the water</li>
  <li>all ages can learn to row and are recognized as an effective means of therapeutic conditioning</li>
  <li>The sport is low impact and doesn't put large amounts of pressure on specific joints </li>
  <li>Rowing is just a fun sport to participate in and that it helps take your mind off stressful topics when you are out on the water</li>

</ul>  
        
        <h2>The types of boats</h2>
        
        <p>There are eight types of boats in the sport which can be customized or changed at one's consent and can contain an extra person which is called the Coxswain who is responsible for steering the boat, safety reasons, coordinating the power and controlling the rhythm of the rowers. Coxswains are always present in larger boats but sometimes aren't present in smaller boats to lessen the overall weight of the boat</p>

  <h2>The Rowing tank</h2>
  
  <p><img id = "float" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTIG9KeWAAA99P5.jpg">A rowing tank is an indoor facility which attempts to mimic the conditions rowers face on open water. Rowers sit in fixed rowing positions, with a channel of water to either side of the 'boat'. Rowing tanks are primarily used for off-season rowing, muscle-specific conditioning, and technique training, or when bad weather does not allow for open water training.
  
  </p>
  
  
  <h2 id = "clear"> How to row </h2>
        <p> Rowing technique contains the catch, the drive, the finish and the recovery. The catch is the initial part of the stroke, The drive is where the power is generated while the finish is the final part of the stroke. Then, the recovery is the initial phase to begin taking a new stroke.These phrases are repeated until a duration of time or distance is completed</p>
        
        <img src="https://reygif.com/media/maquina-remo-15800.gif" alt="rowing man" style="width:250px">
        
       <p><strong>The Catch: </strong>This is when the knees are bent with the shins in a vertical position. The back should be roughly parallel to the thigh without leaning too far and the arms and shoulders should be extended forward and relaxed.</p>
       
        <p><strong>The Drive: </strong>This is when the legs are extended but the body remains in the catch posture. As the legs continue to full extension, the rower engages the core to begin the motion of the body levering backward. When the legs are flat, the rower begins to pull the handle toward the chest.</p>
        
         <p><strong>The Finish: </strong>The legs are at full extension and flat while the arms are in full contraction with the elbows bent and hands against the chest.The back of the rower is still maintained in an upright posture.</p>
         
          <p><strong>The Recovery: </strong>The recovery is a slow slide back to the initial part of the stroke with the actions are in reverse order of the drive. It gives the rower time to recover from the previous stroke. </p>
